## Machine Learning Main Ideas

### Question 1

**Supervised Learning:** For each observation of the predictor
measurements(s), there is an associated response measurement. In
supervised learning, we wish to fit a model that relates the response to
the predictors, with the aim of accurately predicting the response for
future observations (prediction) or better understanding the
relationship between the response and the predictors (inference).

**Unsupervised learning:** For each observation, we observe a vector of
measurements but no associated response. It is not possible to fit a
model (ex. regression) since there is no response variable to predict.
In unsupervised learning we can seek to understand the relationships
between the variables or between the observations.

(Definitions loosely cited from "An introduction to statistical
learning" Textbook)

The key difference between unsupervised and supervised machine learning
is the response variable. In supervised learning, the model trains on
all of the past response variables in order to predict future
observations. This is in stark contrast to unsupervised machine learning
where there is no response variable to train on. Instead (to the best of
my knowledge), unsupervised machine learning seeks to find clusters in
the data to draw inferences about future predictors.

### Question 2

The difference between regression models and classification models is
the type of response variable. Generally, we refer to a problem with a
quantitative response as a regression problem, and that with a
qualitative response as a classification problem. There are some
exceptions to this rule however; as logistic regression is typically
used with a qualitative response.

("An Introduction to Statistical Learning" Textbook)

### Question 3

**Regression:**

One commonly used metric for regression in ML problems is mean squared
error (MSE). MSE will be small if the predicted responded are very close
to the true responses, and will be large if for some of the
observations, the predicted and true responses differ substantially.

Another commonly used metric for regression in ML is the t-statistic for
coefficients of regression. The t-statistic help us calculate a p-value
that will determine how confident the model is in the result of the
coefficient value. Although this does not matter AS much in prediction
models, it is still an important metric for other applications of ML and
regression.

**Classification:**

The most common approach for quantifying the accuracy of classification
models is error rate, which is the proportion of mistakes hat are made
if we apply our estimate to the training observations. ("An Introduction
to Statistical Learning" Textbook)

The Bayes error rate is another metric used to assess the quality of
classification machine learning models. It is defined as the lowest
possible error rate for any classifier of a random outcome. (Wikipedia)

### Question 4

**Descriptive models:** Descriptive models are similar to inferential models, with the
key difference being that descriptive models often aim to summarize a sample, rather
than using the data to learn about the population in which the sample came from.
Descriptive models use various statistical techniques to find patterns in a sample, and
generally not used to infer anything past what is presented in the sample. (Wikipedia)

**Inferential models:** For inferential models, we seek to understand
the association between the response and the predictors. In this model,
we are still seeking to estimate the response but our goal is not
necessarily to make predictions for future responses. Inferential models
help us understand the connection between responses and the associated
predictors, which can help us answer questions such as: *Which
predictors are associated with the response?*, and *What is the
relationship between the response and each predictor?* ("An Introduction
to Statistical Learning" Textbook)

**Predictive models:** For predictive models in machine learning, the
aim of the model is to accurately forecast future responses for a set of
predictors. Practically, there are many situations where a set of inputs
are readily available, but the output cannot be obtained, and thus needs
to be predicted. The aim of this model is to have the lowest coefficient
of determination, while maintaining accurate forecasts.

### Question 5

**Mechanistic:** A mechanistic model predicts the future based off of theory.
In other words, they use theoretical ideas and/or values to make predictions
about the future

**Empirical:** An emperical model predicts the future by using past actualized
values. Additionally, they make predictions by experimenting.

These models differ by the method they use in order to reach the end goal. Empirical
modeling is more of a "trial and error" method of modeling than mechanistic.
The goal of mechanistic modeling is to use theoretical values to perfectly predict
the future, whereas empirical modeling will help you predict something completely new.

The similarities in both of these models is the end goal; both of these models
seek to predict future outcomes and / or values.
